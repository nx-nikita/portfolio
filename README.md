# 💼 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my creative corner on the web — a fully custom-built portfolio that reflects who I am as a web developer. This site is designed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my work, my values, and the experiences that shaped my journey.

## ✨ What's Inside

- 🖥️ **Modern Web Design** — A sleek, minimalist, and fully responsive layout
- 📚 **Project Gallery** — A collection of my top work, with descriptions and live previews
- 🎯 **About Me** — A short story of my coding path, goals, and skills
- 📬 **Contact Me** — A lightweight form to reach out or just say hi

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Tech        | Description                               |
